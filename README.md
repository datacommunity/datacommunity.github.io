# How does it work?
We store JSON content in the relevant repository (tools, resources, blogs, etc.) in the `data.json` file. The content of the JSON file is then consumed by the jQuery/JS code and transformed into a html content. The separate repositores are mainly to make it more transparent and easy to use and to keep the web code isolated.
