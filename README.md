# How does it work?
We store JSON content in the relevant repository (tools, resources, blogs, etc.) in data.json file. The content of the json file is then consumed by the jQuery and transformed into a html content. The separate repositores are mainly to make it more transparent and easy to use and to keep the web code isolated.
